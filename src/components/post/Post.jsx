        This photo consists of a tree. It is a bright day with beautiful blue sky. There are car parked too around the trees. 
        So we can assumate that it is a parking lot. Also there is are small houses which I assume can be laboratories of the hospital. 
        As there is an ambulance too, so it is probably the hospital.
